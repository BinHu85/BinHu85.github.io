	•	PI Bin Hu’s Equipment
PI Hu’s lab is equipped with a heterogenous multi-robotic platform and computing resources to support the proposed research.

	•	 Multi-robotic platform  
The multi-robotic platform is comprised by a ground robot testbed consisting of three ROSbot 2.0 pro autonomous robots and a Jackal J100 robot with a LiDAR 3D - Velodyne Puck (VLP-16) and one Intel RealSense D435 cameras, and a multi-drone platform that includes one VOXL2 AI & 5G development drone Sentinel, three Seeker autonomous SLAM drones and one AI powered customized drone. The platform also includes one Unitree Go2 quadruped robot.
