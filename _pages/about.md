Dr. Bin Hu joins the Department of Engineering Technology at the University of Houston as an Assistant Professor in 2022. Before that, he was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Engineering Technology at Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia. He received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [University of Notre Dame](https://ee.nd.edu/) in 2016, and M.S. in Control Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University in 2010. 

Dr. Bin Hu's research interests lie in areas of learning based control, optimization, machine learning, and their applications in cybersecurity, robotics, human-machine automation, IoT and vehicular networked systems.

## Research Philosophy

Our research focuses on developing **intelligent and safe autonomous systems** that can effectively collaborate with humans in complex, dynamic environments. We bridge the gap between advanced control theory, machine learning, and real-world applications in robotics and autonomous vehicles.

### Key Research Areas:

üéØ **Learning-Based Control**: Developing adaptive control systems that learn from experience and improve performance over time

ü§ñ **Human-Autonomy Teaming**: Creating intelligent systems that understand human intent and collaborate effectively in shared tasks

üõ°Ô∏è **Safe Autonomous Systems**: Ensuring safety and reliability in autonomous operations through robust control and verification methods

üöó **Connected and Autonomous Vehicles**: Advancing vehicle automation and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication for safer transportation

üîí **Cybersecurity for Autonomous Systems**: Protecting autonomous systems from cyber threats and ensuring secure operation

### Research Impact:

Our work has practical applications in aerospace (NASA collaboration), automotive industry, robotics, and cybersecurity. We are committed to developing technologies that enhance human capabilities while ensuring safety and reliability.
